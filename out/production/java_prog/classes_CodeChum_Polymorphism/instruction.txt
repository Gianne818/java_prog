Graphical User Interface or GUl is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based Uls, typed command labels or text navigation. For this, you are tasked to define the following:
Class - InputElement:
Properties:
private int maxLength
private String value

getValue(), setValue(char c): The setter appends c to value or removes the last character if c is %. Use the validate() method to check if the to be added value is valid and will only add the character to the value if it is valid.


Class - PasswordinputElement (inherits InputElement):
Additional Property:
private charil allowedCharacters
Constructor: Accepts int maxLength and charl! allowedCharacters.
Overridden validate(): Checks if all characters in value are in alL wedCharacters.
