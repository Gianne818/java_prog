Object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

Definition of Terms

* Classes - serve as blueprints for creating objects, and allow you to define the structure and behavior of objects.
*Objects - instance of a class.

* Fields - the state or charactersitics of an object, also called attributes. (Variables)
* Methods -  defines the behavior of the objects. (Functions)
* Method Overloading - allows you to define multiple methods with the same name in the same class, but with different parameter lists.

* Constructors - special methods that automatically run once an object is created, needs to have same name as the class. When no (parameterized) constructor is defined, the default constructor is called, with no parameters and no initialization.
* Constructor Overloading - llows you to define multiple constructors within the same class, each taking a different set of parameters. (i.e. different data types, different order of data type definition)

* Access Specifiers - keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields, methods, and nested classes) within different parts of the program.
* public - members declared public are accessible from anywhere within the program, including other classes and packages.
* private - only accessible within the class
* protected - only accessible within the same package or it's subclasses.
* package-private - the default, accessible within the same package 

* Principles of OOP
* Encapsulation - bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.
* Inheritance - mechanism that allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class.
* Polymorphism - ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, typically by method overriding or overloading.
* Abstraction - hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
